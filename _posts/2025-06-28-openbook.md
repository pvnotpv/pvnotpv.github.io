description: OpenBook is a decentralized CLOB on Solana and in this series of blog posts we're going to deep dive into the codebase figure out how the incoming orders are stored.

So it's been over a few weeks since I've been spending time on this project and figuring out how it works under the hood, but apparently there are no documentations, guides, and absolutely no articles online on going into the technical aspects of this project. So obviously I decided to make one and get more better at rust and finance.

> In this particular blog post, I won't be going into how the order matching works but rather how the orders are stored in the form of a critbit/binary tree, which is the most complex part of the codebase.

Here's a final drawing I've done on the the tree which is filled with orders.
